# Abstract

The Western US faces increasing water stress from the impacts of climate change, making it difficult to meet water demands for the regionâ€™s cities, agriculture, and hydropower generators. Existing literature suggests that climate adaptation measures such as water conservation, cropland retirement, wastewater recycling, and managed aquifer recharge can alleviate some of these challenges. Few analyses, however, compare the relative efficacy and system-wide effects of these adaptations under different climate projections across the entire Western United States. Here we use a Western US-wide water systems model to evaluate, by sector and sub-region, how the widespread implementation of these adaptive measures impacts water demands, water deliveries, and electricity use related to the water system for three different climate projections. We find thatwastewater recycling has greater potential to lower unmet indoor water demands than urban indoor water conservation measures. However, when implemented at scale, indoor water conservation reduces electricity use by an average of 683 Terawatt hours while wastewater recycling increases energy use by an average of 721 Terawatt hours, cumulatively from 2020 to 2070. Cropland retirement and aquifer recharge adaptations increase the ability to meet agricultural water demand, increase groundwater storage, and reduce summertime electricity use. While most of these findings are consistent across different climate projections, the benefits of aquifer recharge are sensitive to spatial variation of precipitation. Given the limitations and tradeoffs of each individually, the results suggest that a portfolio of adaptation measures will be needed for a climate-resilient water and energy future in the Western US.

# Software Download for WWSM

The Western U.S. Water Systems Model (WWSM) was developed within the WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning) software platform. WEAP is developed by the research non-profit Stockholm Environment Institute's (SEI) U.S. Center.

To view the WWSM and see the results, you must first download and install WEAP software from https://www.weap21.org/ An evaluation version of the WEAP model is available for free without a license. This evaluation version allows users to open and view the WWSM, and view the saved results from the climate scenarios associated with the above manuscript in submission. To run new scenarios and create new results with different model parameters, a WEAP license is needed and must be acquired through the WEAP website from SEI. A free tutorial on using the WEAP software is available on the website.

Once you have downloaded the WEAP software, download the zipped "backup" WWSM model file (WWSM_WEAPSwitch_V1_0.WEAP) from this repository. Open the backup file with the WEAP software to unzip the model, input data, and saved results.

The input and result csv files that pertain to the model and are included in the zipped backup file are also saved under the data folder of this repo for easier access without the need to download the WEAP software.
